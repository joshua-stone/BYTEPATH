  <summary>A replayable arcade shooter with a focus on build theorycrafting. Use a massive skill tree, many classes and ships to create your own builds and defeat an ever increasing amount of enemies.</summary>
  <description>
    <p>BYTEPATH is a replayable arcade shooter with a focus on varied play styles with RPG elements. The game has a huge passive skill tree, classes and different ships through which you'll be able to try out lots of different builds to achieve ever increasing high scores and eventually beat the game.</p>

    <p>Expect BYTEPATH to be a mix of Bit Blaster XL and Path of Exile, created with the intention of expanding Bit Blaster XL's relaxing and addictive gameplay with Path of Exile's build depth, build diversity and RPG elements.</p>
    <p>
      Gameplay
      - Your ship can't stop moving, so you must turn it left and right or use your boost and brakes to prevent it from crashing on enemies.
      - Your ship can't stop shooting, so you must continually kill enemies and collect ammo so you can keep using your powerful attacks.
      - Items, resources and new attacks will be spawned randomly. Those will provide you with great boosts that may help you achieve higher scores in the current run.
